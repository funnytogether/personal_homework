## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
cfc=read.csv("E:\\BDA\\group_homework\\foodmart\\customer_for_cluster_backup.csv")
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r}
summary(cfc)
```
```{r}
cfcTrain<-cfc[,which(names(cfc) != "锘縞ustomer_id")]
na.omit(cfcTrain)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
```{r}
class(cfcTrain)
dim(cfcTrain)
```
```{r}
cfcTrain=na.omit(cfcTrain)
```
```{r}
set.seed(1234567)
cfcK3<-kmeans(x=cfcTrain,centers=3) 
```
```{r}
cfcK3
```
